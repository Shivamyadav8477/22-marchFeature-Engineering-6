    "It seems like you're interested in understanding the Pearson correlation coefficient and how it can be applied to a scenario involving students' study time and final exam scores. The Pearson correlation coefficient, often denoted as \"r,\" quantifies the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables. In this case, the two variables are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Amount of Time Students Spend Studying for an Exam:** This is a continuous variable that represents the number of hours or minutes students dedicate to studying for a particular exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Final Exam Scores:** This is also a continuous variable that represents the scores students achieve on the final exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collect Data:** Gather data for each student, including the amount of time they spent studying and their corresponding final exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate the Mean and Standard Deviation:** Calculate the mean (average) and standard deviation for both variables (study time and exam scores). These values will be used to standardize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standardize the Data:** For each data point, subtract the mean of its respective variable and divide by the standard deviation. This step is known as standardization or normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the Product of Standardized Values:** Multiply the standardized study time values with the standardized exam score values for each student.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r):** Sum up the products obtained in the previous step and divide by the number of data points. The formula for calculating r is:\n",

    "   - `n` is the number of data points.\n",
    "   - `xi` and `yi` are the standardized values of study time and exam scores for each data point.\n",
    "   - The formula computes the average of the product of these standardized values.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Interpret the Result:**\n",
    "   - If r is close to 1, it indicates a strong positive linear relationship (as study time increases, exam scores tend to increase).\n",
    "   - If r is close to -1, it indicates a strong negative linear relationship (as study time increases, exam scores tend to decrease).\n",
    "   - If r is close to 0, it suggests a weak or no linear relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the Pearson correlation coefficient measures only linear relationships. If the relationship between study time and exam scores is nonlinear, the correlation may not fully capture it. Additionally, correlation does not imply causation; a strong correlation does not necessarily mean that one variable causes the other.\n",

    "You can calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient using various programming tools like Python with libraries such as NumPy and SciPy or by using spreadsheet software like Excel.

    "This analysis provides insights into the soft drink preferences within different age groups based on the survey data. Depending on your research goals, you can further analyze and visualize this data to identify trends or patterns in preferences across age groups."
